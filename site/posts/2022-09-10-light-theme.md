title: Why to use a light theme
description: It might not be such a bad idea as you'd think.

When I started as a developer, I was an avid proponent of dark themes. Especially in a code editor I made an effort to use a dark theme if the app didn't have it out of the box. Even my phone I set to use dark mode everywhere. A few years back however, I made a radical switch to light themes, and never looked back. Nowadays I barely tolerate a dark theme, especially in light environments. Since the default for most developers is still to use a dark theme, I though I'd write a quick post on why I switched and why I think you should try it, too.

When I try to convince people they should try a light theme, I usually link to [this blogpost](https://stitcher.io/blog/why-light-themes-are-better-according-to-science) by Brent Roose. In it he very succintly summarizes some scientific evidence for why a light theme is better. If you want a more in-depth look I recommend [this article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/dark-mode/) by the Nielsen Norman Group. I have to say I was a bit sceptical about this, as from my personal experience a dark theme felt easier on the eyes. But the call to action at the end of Brent's article was a game changer for me:

> Over the past three years, I've put light themes to the test: I've challenged myself and dozens of others to switch to a light theme for one week. I wanna do the same with you: try it for one week

I decided to do that. I spent some time finding a light theme I liked for VS Code (currently I use light version of the [Night Owl theme by Sarah Drasner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl)) and committed to not switching back for a week.
